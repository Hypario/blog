This is the source code of my blog, that is still a work in progress.

This blog will explain in details how I made some of my projects and will talk about multiple subjects such as DevOps (setting up CI/CD, docker...)

But also how to start a project, what tool you can use to write specifications and so on.

This project is made using AdonisJS, you can find the documentation there.

# How to run
First you need to clone the project using git.
Then you need node and npm.

Using npm, install the dependencies

```npm install```

then you can start the server locally

```npm run dev```
